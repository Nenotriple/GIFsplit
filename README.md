# GIFsplit: GIF to PNG Frame Extractor

**Description**

GIFsplit is a Python tool that breaks down a GIF into its separate frames. Each frame is then saved as its own PNG image.

**Functionality**

The script accepts a GIF file as input, traverses through each frame in the GIF, and saves each frame as a separate PNG image. The output images are stored in a newly created directory that shares the name of the input GIF file.

**Usage Instructions**

1. Install the Pillow library via pip using the command: `pip install pillow`
2. Execute the script by dragging and dropping your .gif file onto the .pyw script.
3. The script will create a new directory in the same location as your GIF file.
4. Each frame of the GIF will be saved as an individual .png image within this directory.
